# Idea-Box

## A project by 3 FE mod 1 students at Turing School of Software & Design. 

### Learning Goals:
  * Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    * semantic HTML
    * clean & organized CSS styles
    * DRY and organized JavaScript
  * Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM.
  * Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements.

### Overview of Site:
  * A useful tool for developers or anyone who has an idea they would like to remember.
  * This application is able to record and archive a users ideas in card form.
  * Users are able to add a title and body for their specific idea card.
  * Once an idea card is filled out the user is able to save it to their own collection of idea cards.
  * Users are then able to favorite and delete ideas as they wish from the collection.

### Technologies Used:
  * Atom
  * DEV Tools
  * Terminal
  * Google
  * GitHub

### Challenges:
  * Caleb - Figuring out the favorite toggle in the local storage.
  * Nick - Stepping back and slowing down.
  * Kim - Combining the knowledge from local storage lessons with event bubbling lessons with array.prototype lessons into the big programming stew we have now.


### Wins:
  * Caleb - Being able to clearly articulate my thought processes to my team and figure out bugs because of it!
  * Nick - Getting all the way through iteration 4!
  * Kim - Tackling our challenges together in times of struggle, it was rewarding to see things function properly!
